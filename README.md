# Code for Rational Minimal Models
This repository contains the code that verifies some of the results of the paper *Minimal models of rational elliptic curves with non-trivial torsion* by Alexander Barrios. The codes are written by the author as well.


This code was written on SageMath, and the repository consists of 4 files:

(1) Polynomials.sage

(2) models.sage

(3) Lemma_2-9_and_E_Ts_verifications.ipynb

(4) Lemma_3-1_verification.ipynb

File (1) and (2) contain the definitions that are called by (3) and (4).

File (3) verifies Lemma 2.9.

File (4) verifies Lemma 3.1.
